### I’d like to talk about where you live. Tell me about your favorite room in your home. What does it look like? Why do you like that room?

Actually, i live in a one-room apartment inside a share house.  there is a common area in the center, and everyone has thier own private room.
So my room is basically everything; it's my bedroom, my living room, my closet, and my study space. Even though it's a small space, i can do many things here.
i study for my job search, and this is the only space that i can completely control. i have a comfortable bed and a large window in my room.
people usually want a bigger place, but this small room gives me the most comfort because i can fully control everything here.

### Tell me about some housework you do at home. What do you do to keep your house nice and clean?

when I was young,
AC, cooler, landlord, vacuum cleaner, air freshner, broke down, water was leaking, the power went out
i called the landlord
i had to fix it myself
he sent a repairman
it took a few days to fix
after that, everything was fine.


### Tell me about the home you lived in as a child. How was it different from the home you live in now?
