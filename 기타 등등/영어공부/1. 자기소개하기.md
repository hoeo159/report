### Let’s start the interview now. Tell me something about yourself.

My name is Minho Baek and I'm currently 25 years old.
I live in a share house in Suwon, which is conveniently located right in front of Sungkyunkwan University.
You know, I'm actually a senior in my undergraduate program there and I'm scheduled to graduate next semester.

Well, As I mentioned before, I am currently a senior majoring in Computer Science. Specifically, I have been focusing on LLM-related AI projects and game programming. Furthermore, I want to work in this field.

For hobbies, I often spend time playing online games with my friends or reading books.
I'm reading the "Dragon Raja" series, which is a very famous Korean fantasy novel.
I prefer reading books over watching videos such as youtube, instagram or something else. Because I find it more relaxing, and I enjoy using my imagination to picture the world the text describes.

I often spend time just thinking to myself. Right now, I'm just thinking about an enemy suddenly coming into this room. What should I do? Can i beat him with my two punch?

Anyway, i'm happy to be here for the interview, and i'll do my best.
